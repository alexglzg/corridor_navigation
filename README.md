ROS 2 framework for fast, kinematically-feasible motion planning using the Automatic Corridor Generation (ACG) method. This repository implements a deterministic free-space decomposition into overlapping rectangular corridors for efficient navigation in structured environments, as presented at ICRA 2026.
